            <h1>My Biography</h1>
            <p>I didn't always have passion for tech, I started in the medical field, I have a degree in Human Physiology.</p>
            <p>My passion for tech started in the third year of my degree, all of a sudden I developed a lot of interest for the tech space, and I have to say, I don't have any regrets and infact, I couldn't be happier that I transitioned into tech.</p>
